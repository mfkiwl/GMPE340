# GMPE340 - Kalman Filter and Sensor Integration

## Information
The course will be presented in a hybrid version containing both classical lectures on Campus and digital lectures on Zoom.

## Course contents
Introduction to stochastic processes and applied Kalman filtering with focus on positioning, navigation and time applications (PVT).

## Learning outcome
Students will understand the basic filter derivation based on minimum vari- ance. This is followed by various approaches to basic theory such as in- formation filtering, suboptimal analysis, Bayesian estimation, ratio of least squares (LSQ) and other estimates, smoothing and methods for dealing with non-linearities.

## Learning activities
Lectures, Colloquium, Student presentations, Assignments.

## Prerequisites
Calculus and linear algebra. Differential equations. Parameter estimation.

## Recommended
Good programming skills (Python/C++/MATLAB)
